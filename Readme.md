# ðŸ“˜ Apache Kafka

## 1. Kafka Core Architecture

- **Core Concepts**: Understand topics, partitions, offsets, producers, consumers, brokers, and clusters.
- **Data Model**: Learn about message structure, log compaction, and retention policies.
- **ZooKeeper and KRaft Mode**: Explore the role of ZooKeeper in Kafka and the transition to KRaft (Kafka Raft Metadata mode) for metadata management. ([Sling Academy][1])

## 2. Scalability and Performance

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Study partitioning strategies, adding brokers, and rebalancing partitions.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Optimize broker sizing, disk throughput, and network bandwidth.
- **Performance Optimization**: Tune producer batching, compression, and consumer fetch parameters.&#x20;

## 3. High Availability and Fault Tolerance

- **Replication Mechanism**: Understand in-sync replicas (ISR), leader election, and replica placement strategies.
- **Failure Scenarios**: Learn how Kafka handles broker failures, disk failures, and network partitions.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Explore multi-datacenter deployments and tools like MirrorMaker for replication.&#x20;

## 4. Consistency and Durability

- **Message Delivery Semantics**: Delve into at-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once delivery guarantees.
- **Consumer Group Coordination**: Study group rebalancing protocols and offset management strategies.
- **Quorum and Consensus**: Understand controller election and the KRaft consensus protocol.([redpanda.com][2])

## 5. Advanced Batching and Performance

- **Producer Batching**: Learn about memory allocation, batch sizing, and compression at the batch level.
- **Consumer Fetching**: Optimize poll loops, manage backpressure, and handle heartbeat threads.
- **Disk I/O Optimization**: Explore sequential writes, zero-copy transfer, and log segment management.

## 6. Monitoring and Operations

- **Critical Metrics**: Monitor under-replicated partitions, request handler idle ratio, and consumer lag.
- **Operational Patterns**: Implement rolling broker restarts, partition reassignment, and topic configuration changes.
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify common failure modes and debug high latency issues.

## 7. Kafka Ecosystem

- **Connect API**: Use source and sink connectors for data integration.
- **Streams API**: Design topologies, manage state stores, and perform interactive queries.
- **ksqlDB**: Leverage stream-table duality and persistent queries for real-time analytics.

## 8. Enterprise Considerations

- **Security**: Implement SSL/TLS encryption, SASL authentication, and ACL management.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Manage resource quotas and tenant isolation.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Enforce data retention policies and audit logging.

## 9. Advanced Topics

- **Kafka Internals**: Study the request processing pipeline, log segment management, and controller failover.
- **Extreme Scaling**: Explore tiered storage and scaling beyond 100 brokers.
- **Future Directions**: Stay updated with Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIPs) and cloud-native Kafka developments.

## 10. Real-World Patterns

- **Event Sourcing**: Implement Kafka as an event store and apply CQRS patterns.
- **Microservices Integration**: Facilitate event collaboration and implement the saga pattern.
- **Data Pipeline Architectures**: Design Lambda and Kappa architectures for real-time analytics.

# ðŸ§­ Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start with Kafka's Official Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the basics and core concepts.
2. **Hands-On Practice**: Set up local Kafka clusters and experiment with different configurations.
3. **Study Source Code**: Dive into Kafka's source code to understand its internal workings.
4. **Implement Complex Use Cases**: Work on projects that require exactly-once processing and other advanced features.
5. **Benchmarking**: Test different configurations under load to understand performance implications.
6. **Contribute to the Community**: Participate in Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIPs) and contribute to the Kafka project.
